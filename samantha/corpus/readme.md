# samantha Language Training Corpus

These modules are used to quickly train samantha to respond to various inputs in different languages.
Although much of samantha is designed to be language independent, it is still useful to have these
training sets available to prime a fresh database and make the variety of responses that a bot can yield
much more diverse.

For instructions on how to use these data sets, please refer to the [project documentation](https://github.com/RiskyAINetwork/samantha/wiki/Training).

All training data contained within this corpus is user contributed.

If you are interested in contributing support for a new language please create a pull request. Additions are welcomed!
