							<h3>So, you want to learn a little more about the beast?</h3>
							<br />
							<h4>Some simple Q&A's</h4>
							<pre style="text-align: left;">
Q: How will this change the world?
A: How will you change the world? The answer to most peoples question lies in reflection.

Q: How can I help?
A: Join the github repo. Commit, Add ideas, Help others. Anything is apreciated.

Q: How can I add my plugins to the list?
A: If you create an Issuse under the main repo with the <code>ADD</code> tag, we will add it.

Q: I have an error.
A: That is not a question. Anyway, have you tried <code>bash start.sh error</code>?

Q: How old were you when you made this?
A: I was/am 17 years old. (Year of writing was 2016)

Q: Why did you make this?
A: People are too scared of what the future presents. If you show people that
   they can control it, they are less scared. This is why I am teaching people how to code,
   and make their own modules for Asher.

Q: Why is it called Asher?
A: Why not?

Q: Is this project still active?
A: Well yeah... It is just having a slow period. Maybe we are working on the next break through.

Q: What OS's does this work on?
A: As of this moment in time, We have tested on all OSX versions, and Linux Versions. We will
   be adding support for Windows, and we are wanting to work out why it doesnt install on RPI

Q: Nice site.
A: Not a question. Thanx anyway.

Q: What is with the logo on the installer?
A: That is just a personal thing. It does not hinder the application in anyway.

Q: What are the requirements for this project?
A: Did you even read the Install guide? It says it there.
